Professor O’Brien’s board game “Resistile” helps students practice calculating cumulative resistance in a fun way. However, this game is only available in the class and students who would like to practice further have no option but to solve the “boring”, classical type of resistance problems. If there was an online version of the game, students would be able to play it anytime they want.
